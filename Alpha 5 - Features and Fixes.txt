- Player Lucidity UI fix and functional
- Enemy snapping to point in the level on start is fixed
- Bug that would error when Piney Peter died is fixed
- Adjusted time step back to .01
- Adjusted particle effect for Double jump and Health pick up obj particle effect
- Lucidity pickups on the ground will have a much longer lifespan than if they never collide 
with anything in the level. (This stops lucidity that takes of into infinity from getting there but staying longer if they end up being stopped)
